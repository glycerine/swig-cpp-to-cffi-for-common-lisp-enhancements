I'm forking the swig code to do some enhancements to the C++ to CFFI bindings for common lisp.

The only file that differs from SWIG svn 12570 is Source/Modules/cffi.cxx.

I've got a generation process that wraps alot of C++ code cleanly now. The defmethod names
aren't the prettiest, but we've avoided all congruency issues, so everything compiles and
loads cleanly on my large test code base from a big C++ project.

The point of posting on github is to allow easy testing and further enhancements to the cffi.cxx.
