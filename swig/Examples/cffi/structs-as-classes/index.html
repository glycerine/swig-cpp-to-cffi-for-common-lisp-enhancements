<H2>Generating CLOS wrappers for methods in structures just like in classes</H2>

<p>
 Here we test SWIG's newly added CFFI ability to treat structs as classes and
  thereby to generate methods for structs just as if they were classes
  with all public members (which they are of course in C++, but this feature
  had been previously missing from the "swig -c++ -cffi" implementation).

<blockquote>
<pre>
/* File : example.h */

// example of a struct. Give it the mnemonic name Steven.
struct Steven {
  int _a;
  int the_struct_Steven_has_this_method(int a);
};

// example of a class. Give it the mnemonic name Clarissa.
class Clarissa {
   public:
  int _a;
  int the_class_Clarissa_has_this_method(int a);
};

/* File : example.cxx */

#include "example.h"
#include <stdio.h>

// all classes are declared in example.h

int Steve::the_struct_Steven_has_this_method(int a) {
  _a = a;
  printf("setting Steven._a to %d, and returning that value minus 1.\n",_a);
  return _a -1;
}

int Clarissa::the_class_Clarissa_has_this_method(int a) {
  _a = a;
  printf("setting Clarissa._a to %d, and returning that value minus 1.\n",_a);
  return _a -1;
}


</pre>
</blockquote>




<h2>The SWIG interface</h2>

Click <a href="example.i">here</a> to see a SWIG interface file that
wraps this class and this struct.  In this file, there are a few essential features:

<blockquote>
<pre>

// Tests SWIG's newly added CFFI ability to treat structs as classes and
//  thereby to generate methods for structs just as if they were classes
//  with all public members (which they are, of course, but this feature
//  had been previously missing from the "swig -c++ -cffi" implementation).

%module example

%{
#include "example.h"
%}

%feature("export");

%include "example.h"
%include "example.cxx"

</pre>
</blockquote>



<ul>
<li>A wrapper for the <tt>free()</tt> function is created so that we
can clean up the return result created by <tt>vector_add()</tt>
function.

<p>
<li>The %inline directive is used to create a few helper functions for creating new Vector
objects and to print out the value (for debugging purposes).
</ul>

<h2>A Common Lisp fragment</h2>

Click <a href="runme.lisp">here</a> to see a Common Lisp code fragment that invoke the defined methods using idiomatic CLOS invocations.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>When the '<tt>-c++</tt>' option is used, the resulting wrapper code for the return value
changes to the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
Vector *wrap_vector_add(Vector *a, Vector *b) {
    Vector *r = new Vector(vector_add(*a,*b));
    return r;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Similarly, it would be a mistake to use the <tt>free()</tt> function from C++.  A safer 
approach would be to write a helper function like this:

<blockquote>
<pre>
%inline %{
   void delete_Vector(Vector *v) {
       delete v;
   }
%}
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<li>If you use proxy classes and are careful, the SWIG generated wrappers can automatically
clean up the result of return-by-reference when the scripting variable goes out of scope.

<p>
<li>Passing parameters by value like this really isn't the best C programming style.
If possible, you might change your application to use pointers.

<p>
<li>Similar translations are made when C++ references are used.


</ul>
